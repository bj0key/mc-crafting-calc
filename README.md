# mc-crafting-calc
Python script for recursively finding and tallying the raw ingredients required for a minecraft recipe.
This was a script I wrote a while ago for help crafting some modded items.
By default, this script will not be too useful, as the recipebook is not very extensive. Add additional entries to the `recipebook.py` file to extend the program's knowledge on ingredients. The program should also work correctly on fractional recipes (i.e. 1 log -> 4 planks means 0.25 log -> 1 planks), though this has not been heavily tested.
